  blurb: 'Winter DIPA',
  description: 'This beer was conceived with the intent to push the concept of Doppelganger to the limit of flavor and intensity. Both the kettle hopping rates and dry hopping rates were increased while keeping the base beer the same. The result is intense, but also surprising in its balance and softness. The mouthfeel is viscous and coating with flavors of overripe mango, dank citrus, and tropical fruit balanced by a sharp but pleasant finish. A treat to warm you up as a true New England winter takes hold!')

  blurb: 'Piney IPA',
  description: "Though originally brewed as a \"Christmas\" beer, this piney IPA, brewed almost exclusively Chinook hops, was so enjoyable we decided to put it into the 'year round' rotation.   With it's golden yellow color, rich aroma, and drying body, it's hard to stop drinking this one.")

  blurb: 'Modern APA',
  description: 'A modern American Pale Ale brewed to celebrate a new beginning here at Tree House! Lights On pours a gorgeous hazy orange in the glass, releasing an aroma filled with a bounty of sweet fresh fruit. We taste papaya, guava, and mango - a fresh and distinctive flavor profile that’s wholly Tree House. Buoyed by a soft and fluffy mouthfeel, Lights On is a delight to drink. We’re excited to share it with you!')

  blurb: 'Ausi-American IPA',
  description: 'Our cross-continental IPA.  Made with Australian and American hops, this citrus heavy IPA opens up in the glass with notes of pineapple, tangerine, and orange rind.  It’s sharply bitter and nearly 8% ABV. . . The name comes from the initial batch in which, post boil, the wort looked green from so much hop particulate floating around.  Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.')

  blurb: 'Friuty IPA',
  description: 'We constructed this beer around hops we currently have plenty of access to, allowing us to re-brew it on a (relatively) consistent basis.  We smell a ton of orange on the nose, with complimentary notes of peach and passionfruit. The flavor is similar with a blast of citrus fruit & orange quickly followed by spicy grapefruit, and earthy dankness.  A lingering but pleasant hop oil finish awaits.')

  blurb: 'Blonde Ale',
  description: 'A Blonde Ale brewed entirely with Nelson Sauvin hops, a New Zealand varietal that melds beautifully with a simple bill of pale malts.   This is a true "session beer" and one that does not make any compromises.  It has a delicate bouquet of passionfruit and a slight lemon flavor that will surely quench your thirst.  We have also brewed a few different versions to include new hop varieties like Equinox, Galaxy, and Citra!')

  blurb: 'Mosaic Double IPA',
  description: 'Bright was created to be a clean and elegant showcase for one of our favorite hops - Mosaic! It is crafted with a simple malt bill and fermented with clean American Ale yeast to create a flavor profile that is more a function of its vibrant fresh ingredients than an expression of yeast character. Bright’s aroma is a cornucopia of citrus dank. The taste follows suit with notes of grapefruit, sweet berries, and clementine with a gentle orange rind finish. She is dry, soft, deceptively juicy and adequately bittered resulting in a very approachable yet pungent Double IPA. We hope you find this bit of a departure as enjoyable as we do!')
