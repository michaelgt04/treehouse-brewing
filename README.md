# Treehouse Brewing 

## Upgrading the Site

I'm a huge fan of Treehouse Brewing and have stood in a line there many a weekend waiting for
their excellent beer! The IPAs are incredible and come to think of it, so are all their other
beers! It has been super exciting to watch them grow through multiple different breweries.

Unfortunately, it seems that their site hasn't been growing with them. I had three main goals
in trying to create an updated site for them:

1. I wanted the site to allow for quicker user interaction. It appears they built the site on
top of one of the popular content management systems and it is sometimes sluggish. The layout
also can feel quite cluttered at times, making it hard to glean the necessary information.

2. Put the focus on their beer. They have lots of really beautiful photography of their products
but I felt it was not being leverage to its fullest extent.

3. Allow for a better understanding of what beers they have on tap. The site should have a 
better way for visitors to see a live update of the beers still available for the day. Given
their recent shift to a much larger facility where guests will often have to wait outside
for close to an hour, this can be a very frustrating experience. The current site simply
isn't updated enough for it to be useful.

To be clear, this is really just a fan site, but I wanted to see what I can do!

## Technologies

* React on Sinatra Front End
	
	While Rails is awesome, I felt that this project didn't need the heavier framework. The 
	backend logic is fairly simple and minimal, so it doesn't need the full featured Rails. I
	really just wanted to something to serve my JS code up to the browser.

	I also wanted to get a better sense of what Rails has been doing for me this past year.
	Given that I'd have to setup all the various plugins myself (I'm looking at you SASS
	preprocessing), I figured this could also be a valuable opportunity to see more of what 
	is going on under the hood in Rails

* Custom CSS
	
	This was another project to allow me to practice my CSS skill. CSS is something that 
	doesn't intuitively make sense to me, so I wanted to continue to work at getting better
	with it. 

* Thinking Through End User Needs
	
	While not really a technology, I just wanted something where I could design technology with 
	an end user in mind. This gave me the chance to think through something from the point of view
	of a business and think about how my code canhelp them better deliver their product. It
	was a ton of fun.
